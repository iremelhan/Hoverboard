# Hoverboard
In this project, I created the hoverboard. I styled boxes with CSS. The boxes set to 500 in the JavaScript and it is going to paint that number of boxes. I have an array of colors that will basically have to choose from for each box when we hover over it. So, this gives us cool effect. Also, I use some CSS transitions and I adjusted the size of the boxes thanks to CSS.
